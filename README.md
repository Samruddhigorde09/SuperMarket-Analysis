# SuperMarket-Analysis
This project involves analyzing supermarket sales data to extract meaningful insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency. Using Microsoft Excel, the dataset was cleaned, structured, and analyzed to uncover trends in revenue, product performance, and customer preferences. Key metrics like total sales, branch-wise revenue, and average customer ratings were calculated, while visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs were created to make insights intuitive and actionable.
